# 🌟Hey there! I'm Omar Wael
## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!
I'm thrilled you're here! I’m Omar Wael, a self-taught developer with a deep love for all things tech, especially AI and web development. I’m the kind of person who finds joy in solving problems, learning new things, and occasionally, diving into a good chess game or a speedball match.

## 🚀 A Bit About Me
💡 What I’m Into: Lately, I’ve been diving into AI, building websites, and crafting mobile apps. I’m particularly passionate about projects that blend creativity with technology.

🎓 My Learning Path: My coding journey kicked off with a simple HTML/CSS project. Fast forward, and now I’m tackling more complex challenges, from AI-driven apps to full-stack web development.

🌍 Fun Fact: Outside of coding, I’m either on the chessboard plotting my next move or on the speedball court, pushing my limits. Both hobbies have sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of strategy.
## 🔧 Some of My Projects
Here’s a peek into what I’ve been working on:

❤ Love Extension: This is a fun Chrome extension that sends a heart emoji to a selected person on Instagram every time you open Chrome. Who doesn’t need a bit more love in their day?

🏃‍♂️ Speedball Tracker: A full-stack web app I built to help my speedball team save time during practice. It streamlines data entry, so we can focus on what really matters—playing the game!

🕵️ 7essa Free: An Android party game app with a twist. Instead of guessing places or foods, you guess which friend is in the photo. It’s a work in progress, but I’m excited about where it’s headed!

🎥 Frame Selector: This Python script is a lifesaver during data collection for object detection AI. It lets you pick out only the frames you need from a video, cutting down on the clutter and saving tons of time.


## 📜 Certifications
Harvard CS50 Series: I’ve tackled courses in programming, cybersecurity, and databases, building a solid foundation in these key areas.

AICE Program (ALX): As part of the Artificial Intelligence Certified Expert program, I’m honing my skills in AI, prompt engineering, and machine learning. This program is all about mastering AI, and I’m loving every minute of it!

## 🤖 What I’m Up To Now
Menu Randomizer Website: I’m working on making this site even smarter, thanks to the Gemini LLM. It’s pretty cool to see how AI can help make decisions easier (and tastier!).

Custom Object Detection AI for Speedball: I’m gathering data and training an AI to detect ball hits in speedball, aiming to improve accuracy and possibly replace human judges in the future.
